# safe_spatial_stats

A repository for assessing the spatial variation of the SAFE project vegetation plots.
This is primarily useful to the SAFE 2024 soil nutrient sampling campaign.

This includes a script (`download_script.R`) to download the relevant spatial data,
microclimate, topographic, etc using the existing safedata system, and a script to
perform a principal component analysis to categorise vegetation plots.

We also want to perform an analysis of distances of plots from the nearest channel, this
may or may not form a separate script.

This README is likely to be the only documentation, should get updated with relevant
details as the project develops
