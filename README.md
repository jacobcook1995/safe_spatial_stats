# safe_spatial_stats

A repository for analyses related to the SAFE 2024 soil nutrient sampling campaign.

At the moment, it contains two main analyses.

1) A search (using `safedata`) for existing data for the SAFE carbon plots and subplots.
   The code related to this is found in the `detailed_carbon_data_search` folder
2) An assessment of the spatial variation of the SAFE project vegetation plots. This
   involves downloading the relevant spatial data, (microclimate, topographic, etc)
   using the `safedata` system, and performing a principal component analysis to
   categorise vegetation plots. The code related to this can be found in the
   `subplot_selection` folder
3) An analysis of the soil nutrient data for the SAFE vegetation and carbon plots.

This README is likely to be the only documentation, should get updated with relevant
details as the project develops
